## Environment Configuration

Integrated Configuration Module so you can just inject `ConfigService`
and read all environment variables from `.env` file.
Don't forget to make your own `.env` file!

## Swagger

RESTful APIs you can describe with already integrated Swagger.
To see all available endpoints visit http://localhost:3000/api/docs

## TypeORM integrated

[TypeORM](http://typeorm.io/) gives you possibility to use next db types:
`mysql`, `postgres`, `mariadb`, `sqlite`, etc. Please look at docs for more details.
We have provided working example with `sqlite`, but you have possibility to change
this through `ormconfig.json`. By default you will get `sqlite-example.sql` file
created in the root directory, but it's ignored by git.

## Authentication - JWT

Already preconfigured JWT authentication.
It's suggested to change current password hashing to something more secure.
You can start use already working implementation of `Login` and `Registration`
endpoints, just take a look at [http://localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs).
