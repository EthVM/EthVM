# EthVM: Open Source Ethereum Blockchain Explorer

![Screenshot example](.github/assets/ethvm.png)

## Warning

We're on active development! So things may broke or not work as expected and documentation may be deprecated! You have been warned!

## Philosophy

We have strong foundations on how an Open Source explorer should be:

- **Empower the people**: Give people the ability to inspect the Ethereum blockchain (and other related networks) easily, pretty much like [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) does (but without being closed source).
- **Open source & audit-able**: Having an open source foundation, will guarantee free access to inspect, audit and modify whatever you want or need, without any vendor lock-in.
- **People are the Priority**: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads).
- **A learning experience, too**: We want to educate about Ethereum, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Ethereum and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
- **Private**: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know who / what / where you are.
