## About

### What is EthVM?
EthVM is an open-source [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) Blockchain Data Processing and Analytics Engine with a client-side Block Explorer, although other networks and forks will be supported over time. EthVM is built by the [MyEtherWallet](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet) team and is secured under the [SSPL license](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license) (a small variation of the GNU Affero License v3) and is written in a mixture of different languages.

Our core infrastructure is based on well known languages:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Block Explorer)
- Javascript (API/Processor)

And also is backed by popular frameworks:

- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Apollo Graphql](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/)
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

Our Block Explorer is currently in Beta right now. You can check it out live at [www.ethvm.com](https://www.ethvm.com/) and read more about it [here](https://medium.com/myetherwallet/introducing-mews-ethereum-blockchain-explorer-ethvm-beta-78e5b849e2fc). We are currently focused on bug fixes while we work on adding new features in the near future. If you have any questions or requests, feel free to open an issue or send us an email at *dev@ethvm.com*.


## Getting Started

Right now you can only view EthVM’s Block Explorer (front-end) code. We will be merging the api and processor into the same repo within a couple of weeks, so you can inspect the entire project after the merge.

You can run  `yarn start:dev` within the newclient folder, but you will not be able to propagate any data to the front-end, since the api code base has yet to be merged. However, you can still check out the front-end, and we greatly appreciate any PRs that can improve on code readability - including commentary and structure!


## Contributing

We welcome every kind of contribution, so, please see [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to proceed.
